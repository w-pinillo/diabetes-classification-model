# README - Diabetes Readmission Classification Model

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of different classification models to predict outcomes based on a given dataset. The models evaluated include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Neural Network. The primary objective is to assess the performance of these models using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Models Evaluated
Logistic Regression:

Baseline model with an accuracy of 0.49.

Random Forest:

An ensemble model that achieved an accuracy of 0.57.

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):

A feedforward artificial neural network that also obtained an accuracy of 0.57.

Neural Network:

The most complex model evaluated, achieving the highest accuracy of 0.58.

## Conclusion
The evaluation indicates that while the Logistic Regression model serves as a baseline, more complex models like the Random Forest and Neural Network provide improved accuracy, with the Neural Network offering the best performance overall.
